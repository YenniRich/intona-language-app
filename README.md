# intona-language-app
An AI-powered app to help users speak with better intonation and pitch awareness



# 🎵 Intona – Speak in Melody

**A language learning app that teaches speaking through intonation and pitch visualization.**

## 🌟 Why This App?

Even fluent speakers struggle with **intonation**, which impacts clarity and confidence.  
Inspired by musical pitch training and karaoke apps, this project helps learners hear and mimic the "melody" of natural speech.

> “안녕하세요” sounds better when you say it like ♪ 라 시 도 미 레#
